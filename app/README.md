# app

Local server
------------

This app comes with a simple server ([`server.js`](./server.js)), but can be served through any means.

To use the packaged server:

* Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* From the `app` root directory, run
```
npm install
npm start
```

Note that if you don't have npm installed you will need to run before:
```
sudo apt install npm
```

Browse to `http://localhost:8080/`
